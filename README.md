# Django-skeleton

Project for learning Django Web Development using [coingecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation)

## To Be Done

* Lacking Bulma CSS in several templates
* Add logic in the portfolio tab to display more useful info for the user instead of only the coins they choose
* Add password recovery

## Improvements

Use technology like Celery for real time updates in the API
